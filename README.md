## 🎭 What Is This?

A fully interactive web-based OS simulator that serves as a developer portfolio. Three distinct themes, one chill experience:

- **🎨 Retro/Indie** - Hand-drawn aesthetic with personality
- **🍎 macOS** - Sleek, glassy, and familiar
- **🐧 Linux** - Terminal-first minimalism

Choose your vibe at boot, explore projects, contact me, or mess around in a functional terminal. It's a portfolio, but make it *fun*.

```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and prepare for the boot selector.

## 🎨 Customization

### Update Your Info

Edit `config.ts` to personalize:

```typescript
export const userProfile = {
  name: "Your Name",
  role: "Your Title",
  email: "your@email.com",
  // ... more fields
};

export const projects = [
  {
    title: "Cool Project",
    description: "What it does",
    tags: ["React", "TypeScript"],
    link: "https://github.com/...",
    color: "bg-blue-100"
  },
  // Add more projects
];
```

### Change Wallpapers

Add wallpaper URLs in `components/apps/SettingsApp.tsx`:

```typescript
const WALLPAPERS = [
  { name: 'Your Wallpaper', url: 'https://...' },
  // Add more
];
```

### Modify Terminal File System

Edit the mock file system in `components/apps/TerminalApp.tsx`:

```typescript
const fileSystem: Record<string, FileSystemItem> = {
  'root': {
    name: 'root',
    type: 'folder',
    children: [
      // Customize folders and files
    ]
  }
};
```
